  <h3>Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are comets and asteroids that have been nudged by the 
    gravitational attraction of nearby planets into orbits that allow them to enter the Earthâ€™s neighborhood. 
    Composed mostly of water ice with embedded dust particles, comets originally formed in the cold outer planetary system while most of the rocky 
    asteroids formed in the warmer inner solar system between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The scientific interest in comets and asteroids is due largely 
    to their status as the relatively unchanged remnant debris from the solar system formation process some 4.6 billion years ago.(NASA.gov)</h3>
